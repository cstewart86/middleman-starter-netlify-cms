It’s now widely known that speed is one of the key factors that search engines use to determine the quality of your website. But how do you know if you have a problem?

In this guide we’ll take you through some diagnostic tests to determine whether your website has a speed problem and what you can do about it.

## Auditing your website 

Your first port of call is Google Pagespeed Insights. This is a great tool which loads your site in Chrome in the background and spits out a list of recommendations to improve your website speed. 

Some of the recommendations you receive will be quite technical but it will provide your site with a speed score out of 100 for both mobile and desktop users - the key distinction between the two is that, since mobile visitors are often on a slower connection, what might seem like a reasonable speed on a WiFi connection might be unusual for your mobile visitors.

It’s important to note that scores of 100 in this test are very rare. Here at Redwave, we tend to aim for a minimum score of 85+ on mobile and 90+ on desktop.

If your scores are significantly below this, you’re almost certainly being penalised to some extent by search engines so it’s worth taking the time to improve your score. 

If you’re hungry for more information, you can also visit website.grader.com which will analyse your site on a number of key areas, including speed.

GT Metrix is another good tool to assess site speed. The majority of recommendations it provides will only be understood by a developer but it does provide two grades, provided by two different scoring systems, which can give you an indication of how your site compares.
