It’s now widely known that speed is one of the key factors that search engines use to determine the quality of your website. But how do you know if you have a problem?

In this guide we’ll take you through some diagnostic tests to determine whether your website has a speed problem and what you can do about it.

## Auditing your website

Your first port of call is Google Pagespeed Insights. This is a great tool which loads your site in Chrome in the background and spits out a list of recommendations to improve your website speed. 

Some of the recommendations you receive will be quite technical but it will provide your site with a speed score out of 100 for both mobile and desktop users - the key distinction between the two is that, since mobile visitors are often on a slower connection, what might seem like a reasonable speed on a WiFi connection might be unusual for your mobile visitors.

It’s important to note that scores of 100 in this test are very rare. Here at Redwave, we tend to aim for a minimum score of 85+ on mobile and 90+ on desktop.

If your scores are significantly below this, you’re almost certainly being penalised to some extent by search engines so it’s worth taking the time to improve your score. 

If you’re hungry for more information, you can also visit website.grader.com which will analyse your site on a number of key areas, including speed.

GT Metrix is another good tool to assess site speed. The majority of recommendations it provides will only be understood by a developer but it does provide two grades, provided by two different scoring systems, which can give you an indication of how your site compares.

## Fixing any issues

A lot of speed issues are quite technical but we've set out below some fixes that you can make with yourself along with some more technical considerations to allow you to have an informed discussion with your developer.

### Optimising images

One of the major factors in a slow loading website is often image size. Fortunately this is quite an easy one to fix. 

The best way that we have found to optimise our images is to use an app called Squoosh which was developed by the engineers at Google.

You can load your images into Squoosh which will compress them without any visible loss of quality. You can then download the optimised versions and replace the unoptimised versions on your site.

If you use WordPress, it’s also worth installing a plugin such as EWWW Image Optimizer or reSmush.it which will automatically compress any images you upload. They don’t tend to provide quite the same savings that Squoosh does but they do make the process very easy.

### Use a content delivery network

Another optimisation which can have a dramatic effect on performance is the use of a content delivery network. 

A content delivery network is a global network of servers which each hosts a copy of your files.

What this means in practice is that rather than your visitors potentially waiting for every file on your site to be sent to the, from a single server on the other side of the world, your visitors will be sent the files from a server much closer to them.

These servers are also specially configured to be able to deliver files quickly. 

If you own a large website, a content delivery network can be expensive to run but for smaller websites, the leading content delivery network provider, Cloudflare, offers a free package.

### Remove unused plugins

It’s possible that your website, particularly if it’s a Wordpress website, may have a large number of plugins. 

Plugins can be an incredibly useful and cost effective way of adding advanced functionality to your website but they often come with a speed cost. 

If there are plugins on your site which you don’t use, removing them is likely to improve the speed of your site.
